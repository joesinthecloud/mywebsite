Joe‚Äôs Cloud & DevOps Portfolio ‚Äî Resilient Static Hosting (PoC)

Note: My primary portfolio is hosted at https://www.joesinthe.cloud.

This site (joesinthecloud.net) is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates resilient static hosting using GitHub Pages (primary) fronted by AWS CloudFront with S3 failover, automated via GitHub Actions with OIDC (no static AWS keys).

üöÄ Executive Summary

I built a static portfolio site engineered for high availability and secure automation:

Primary origin: GitHub Pages

CDN & failover: Amazon CloudFront with an origin group (GitHub ‚Üí S3 mirror)

Private mirror: S3 bucket (OAC; not public)

TLS: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM, us-east-1)

DNS: Route 53 (delegated from registrar)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions builds Jekyll, publishes to Pages, syncs to S3, and invalidates CloudFront

Auth: GitHub ‚Üí AWS OIDC (temporary creds, least privilege)

Why this matters: it‚Äôs a production-style pattern showing CDN fronting, origin failover, DNS+TLS, IaC-like repeatability, and a secure federated CI/CD pipeline.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture (What & Why)

Route 53 ‚Üí Aliases apex & www to CloudFront

ACM (us-east-1) ‚Üí Cert for joesinthecloud.net, www.joesinthecloud.net

CloudFront ‚Üí TLS termination, caching, Brotli/Gzip, origin failover

Primary origin: *.github.io with origin path /mywebsite

Secondary origin: S3 mirror (private) via OAC

Default root object: index.html

Origin request policy: Managed-AllViewerExceptHostHeader (ensures GitHub sees its expected Host)

S3 Mirror ‚Üí private bucket, public access blocked; readable only by CloudFront (OAC)

GitHub Actions ‚Üí Jekyll build ‚Üí Pages deploy ‚Üí download artifact ‚Üí sync to S3 ‚Üí CloudFront invalidation

IAM + OIDC ‚Üí Trusts only this repo/environment; policies limited to the mirror bucket + CloudFront invalidation

üîÅ CI/CD Flow

Push to main

Build with Jekyll ‚Üí _site/

Upload built site as Pages artifact

Deploy to GitHub Pages

Download artifact, extract, sync to S3 (mirror)

Invalidate CloudFront to refresh the edge

‚úÖ Validation & Failover Testing

Direct Pages URL should load the site (project path).

CloudFront domain should load the site; / resolves via index.html.

Simulate GitHub outage by marking primary origin unhealthy ‚Üí confirm S3 mirror serves content.

Each deploy ends with a CloudFront invalidation so changes appear quickly.

üìö What I Learned

Federated IAM with OIDC: read JWT claims and scoped trust precisely to my repo/workflow.

CloudFront origin groups: primary/secondary, failover codes, and the importance of Host header handling.

Static site CI/CD: build artifacts, Pages deploy, artifact reuse for S3 mirroring, and edge invalidation.

DNS & TLS: Route 53 delegation + ACM (us-east-1) requirements for CloudFront.

Resilience mindset: testing failover and designing for no single point of failure.
